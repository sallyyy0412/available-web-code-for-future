      <p>I am 28 years old and I just graduated from UC- San Diego with econ major in 2016, I had been working at a logistic company for almost five years since I graduated, after that I went back to Taiwan visit my family right before covi-19 outbreak.  Due to the concern from my family, I took a break from work during the pandemic, meanwhile I decided to take UCSD Extension Data Science and Analysis Bootcamp to learn new skills for a new carrier path. I am a passion; outgoing person and I feel comfortable with people. I am flexible, focus and determinate. when I start my job, I will do whatever it takes to finish it. I am creative but I am also an organized person which makes me cable to handle multiple assignment. Hard worker and quick learner are what my manager used to describe me. I am skilled with Microsoft office , photoshop, python, SQL, Web building, CSS and Java Script. I am always interested at learning new things so I am willing to learn whatever it requires for the job.</p>
